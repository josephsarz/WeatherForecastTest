# WeatherAppTest

Using the weather map API (https://openweathermap.org/api), create an android app that shows today’s weather forecast and 5 day weather forecasts for any city. 

App features

1.       The default city should be the user’s current location.

2.       Users should be able to enter the name of a city and get the latest weather forecast.

3.       The app should show old data when there is no network.

Technical requirements

1.       App should be written in Kotlin.

2.       The project should be developed based on Android MVVM architecture using android architecture components (ViewModel,                Room Persistence, LiveData, Lifecycle).

3.       Use Retrofit2 and Gson to consume the weather REST API.

4.       Write unit test for each feature.
